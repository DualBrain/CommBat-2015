# CommBat-2015

This will chronicle my attempts at re-creating a fantastic TRS-80 multiplayer
game via Javascript.

In the past, I have made abortive attempts in both QuickBasic 4.5 and Turbo C.

In an effort to make the game platform agnostic as possible - Javascript was selected for my next attempt.
